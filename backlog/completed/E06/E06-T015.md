# E06-T015: Document Prescriptive Workflow Style in KB

> **CONSOLIDATED:** This task was absorbed into E06-T014a on 2026-01-16.

## Description

Document the historical "prescriptive" workflow style used in E01-E05. This style had analysts writing detailed implementation code in specs. Label as historical/archived.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Workflow page created at `apps/docs/src/ai-development/workflows/prescriptive.md`
- [ ] AC2: Documents the prescriptive workflow pattern
- [ ] AC3: References archived agent/command definitions
- [ ] AC4: Clearly labeled as historical / no longer used for new tasks
- [ ] AC5: Sidebar updated with new page
- [ ] AC6: `pnpm docs:build` succeeds with no errors

## Source Material

- Archived agents: `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/`
- Archived commands: `.claude/archive/1_16/commands/`
- Example prescriptive specs: `backlog/docs/specs/E05/`

## Output Location

- `apps/docs/src/ai-development/workflows/prescriptive.md`

## Out of Scope

- Deliberative workflow (T016)
- Modifying archived files
