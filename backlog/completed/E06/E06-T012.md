# Add Recommendations/Improvements Tracking System

## Description

Create a systematic way to track technical debt, enhancement opportunities, and non-blocking improvements identified during epic reviews, code reviews, and development. This provides visibility into what should be addressed without cluttering the main backlog.

## Why This Matters

After epic reviews and code/QA reviews, valuable recommendations get buried in review documents:

```markdown
### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

3. **Make connection pool configurable** (from E01-T003 code review)
   - Severity: Medium
   - Type: Enhancement
   - Recommendation: Consider for next epic
   - Estimated Effort: Small (2h)
```

**Where does this go?** Currently: nowhere systematic.

This leads to:
- Lost technical debt context
- No prioritization framework
- Forgotten medium/low priority items
- No visibility into total debt across domains

## What Success Looks Like

- Dedicated `/improvements/` section in KB
- Domain-specific pages (auth, database, api, ai, testing, infrastructure)
- Cross-domain index with statistics and critical items
- Standardized table format for consistent tracking
- Integration with epic review workflow
- At least 5 items backfilled from E01-E05 epic reviews

## Scope

**Included:**
- Folder structure: `apps/docs/src/improvements/`
- Index page with overview and statistics
- 6 domain pages (auth, database, api, ai, testing, infrastructure)
- Contributing guide integration
- Policy documentation page
- VitePress sidebar configuration
- Backfill examples from completed epic reviews
- Workflow integration instructions

**Not Included (Future):**
- Automation scripts (ID validation, stats generation)
- CI enforcement (fail on stale Critical items)
- Auto-population from epic reviews
- GitHub Issues integration

## Technical Approach

### Structure

```
apps/docs/src/improvements/
├── index.md              # Overview + stats + critical items
├── auth.md               # Authentication improvements
├── database.md           # Database improvements
├── api.md                # API improvements
├── ai.md                 # AI improvements
├── testing.md            # Testing improvements
└── infrastructure.md     # DevOps improvements
```

### ID Format

`{DOMAIN}-{NNN}` (e.g., `AUTH-042`, `DB-015`, `TEST-007`)

### Priority Levels

| Level | Definition | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Critical | Blocks deployment, security vulnerability | Immediate |
| High | Significant performance/UX impact | 2-3 sprints |
| Medium | DX, code quality improvements | Within epic |
| Low | Nice-to-have enhancements | Backlog |

### Table Format

```markdown
| ID | Issue | Description | Impact | Effort | Tracking | Added |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| AUTH-001 | Security | OAuth CSRF validation | High | Medium | E02-T015 | 2026-01-10 |
```

2. Update contributing overview
3. Document decision frameworks
4. Add examples

### Phase 3: Population
1. Review E01-E05 epic reviews
2. Extract non-task recommendations
3. Assign IDs following convention
4. Distribute to domain pages
5. Update index statistics

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Document epic review workflow
2. Update task completion process
3. Add to CLAUDE.md
4. Validate and announce

## Policy Reference

Full decision framework, categorization criteria, and lifecycle management documented in:
- [E06-T012-policy.md](../../docs/specs/E06/E06-T012-policy.md)

Key policy decisions:
- ID format: `{DOMAIN}-{NNN}`
- 4 priority levels with clear criteria
- Blocking status: Yes/No based on deployment impact
- Lifecycle: Active → In Progress → Completed → Archived
- Maximum age: 6 months for Low priority items
