# Cross-Linking Conventions and Contribution Guide

## Description

Establish conventions for cross-referencing between KB articles, linking to code files and backlog tasks. Write a comprehensive contribution guide that explains how to add and update KB documentation.

## Why This Matters

Consistent linking makes documentation navigable and traceable. A contribution guide ensures new docs (human or agent-authored) follow established patterns. Without standards, the KB will become inconsistent and hard to maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Reference section template defined for all KB docs
- [x] AC2: Convention for linking to backlog tasks documented
- [x] AC3: Convention for linking to source code files documented
- [x] AC4: Convention for linking to other KB docs (relative paths)
- [x] AC5: Contribution guide written at apps/docs/src/contributing/documentation.md
- [x] AC6: Templates provided for each doc type (concept, pattern, decision, troubleshooting)
- [x] AC7: Frontmatter requirements documented with examples
- [x] AC8: Domain selection guidance (where does my doc go?)
- [x] AC9: Staleness tracking explained (how to keep docs fresh)
- [x] AC10: Existing testing KB content integrated into structure
- [x] AC11: Guide linked from KB homepage

## Constraints

- Links should work in both VitePress site and raw GitHub markdown
- Relative paths preferred for portability
- Task references should be machine-parseable for tooling
- Guide should be actionable, not just rules
- Templates should be copy-pasteable

## Out of Scope

- Automatic link generation
- Backlinks (showing what links to a page)
- External link validation
- Style guide for prose (grammar, tone)
- Spell check or linting setup

## Context

### Reference Section Template

Every KB doc should end with:

```markdown
## References

**Implements:** [E02-T002](../../../backlog/completed/E02/E02-T002.md)

**Key Files:**

- [session.service.ts](../../../packages/auth/src/session.service.ts) - Session CRUD operations
- [session.middleware.ts](../../../apps/api/src/middleware/session.middleware.ts) - Request hook

**Related Docs:**

- [OAuth Flow](./oauth-flow.md)
- [Guard Middleware Pattern](../patterns/guard-middleware.md)
```

### Linking Conventions

| Link Type             | Format                | Example                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| KB doc (same domain)  | `./file.md`           | `[Sessions](./sessions.md)`                                           |
| KB doc (other domain) | `../domain/path.md`   | `[CASL](../auth/concepts/casl.md)`                                    |
| Completed task        | Relative path         | `[E02-T002](../../../backlog/completed/E02/E02-T002.md)`              |
| Source file           | Relative from kb root | `[session.service.ts](../../../packages/auth/src/session.service.ts)` |
| External URL          | Full URL              | `[Fastify Docs](https://fastify.dev/)`                                |

### Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
title: Session Lifecycle
related_code:
  - packages/auth/src/session.service.ts
  - apps/api/src/middleware/session.middleware.ts
implements_task: E02-T002
last_verified: 2026-01-13

```

### Doc Type Templates

```markdown
# [Concept Name]

## Overview

[1-2 paragraphs explaining what and why]

## How It Works

[Detailed explanation]

## Usage Examples

[Code from actual implementation]

## References

[Standard reference section]
```

**Pattern Doc:**

```markdown
# [Pattern Name]

## Problem

[What problem does this solve?]

## Solution

[How does the pattern work?]

## Implementation

[Code showing the pattern]

## When to Use / When Not to Use

[Guidance]

## References

```

**Decision Record (ADR):**

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Decision Title]

## Context

[What situation led to this?]

## Decision

[What was decided?]

## Consequences

[Positive, negative, neutral impacts]

## Alternatives Considered

[What else was evaluated?]

## References

[Standard reference section]
```

**Troubleshooting Doc:**

```markdown
# [Problem Summary]

## Symptoms

## Cause

[Why does this happen?]

## Solution

[Step-by-step fix]

## Prevention

[How to avoid in future]

## References

[Standard reference section]
```

### Existing Content to Integrate

The existing `docs/kb/testing/` content should be integrated:

- `docs/kb/testing/fastify/README.md` → `apps/docs/src/testing/index.md`
- `docs/kb/testing/fastify/plugin-encapsulation.md` → `apps/docs/src/testing/patterns/fastify-encapsulation.md`

### Domain Selection Guide

| Your Topic                 | Domain            | Subdirectory          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| How something works        | {relevant domain} | concepts/             |
| How to implement something | {relevant domain} | patterns/             |
| Why we chose X over Y      | {relevant domain} | decisions/            |
| Fixing a problem           | {relevant domain} | troubleshooting/      |
| Cross-cutting concern      | architecture      | appropriate subfolder |
| Contributing guidance      | contributing      | -                     |
