# E06-T014a: Document Archived Workflow System in KB

## Description

Create complete reference documentation for the **archived prescriptive workflow system**: agents, commands, and workflow overview. This consolidates all historical documentation into one task.

### Section Purpose

The KB needs historical documentation of the prescriptive workflow for:
- Understanding tasks with `agentic_style: "prescriptive"` markers
- Learning from the evolution of our workflow approach
- Providing context for why the deliberative approach was adopted

## Why This Matters

The project evolved from prescriptive to deliberative workflow. Without documenting the prescriptive approach, future developers won't understand:
- Why older specs contain detailed implementation code
- The context behind `agentic_style: "prescriptive"` markers
- The rationale for the current deliberative approach

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Prescriptive workflow overview page created at `apps/docs/src/ai-development/workflows/prescriptive.md`
- [x] AC2: Archived agent summaries documented in `apps/docs/src/ai-development/agents/deprecated/` (one page per agent)
- [x] AC3: Archived command summaries documented in `apps/docs/src/ai-development/commands/archived.md` (single grouped page)
- [x] AC4: Index page `agents/deprecated/index.md` updated with links to individual agent pages
- [x] AC5: Each page clearly labeled as "Historical / Archived" with warning callout
- [x] AC6: VitePress sidebar updated to include new pages under "Deprecated Agents"
- [x] AC7: `pnpm docs:build` succeeds with no errors

## Constraints

- **Content source**: Reference archived files in `.claude/archive/1_16/` - summarize, don't duplicate
- **Historical framing**: All pages must clearly indicate these are no longer used for new tasks
- **Cross-references**: Link to E06-T014b for current deliberative approach
- **Maintenance**: Include `source_synced_at` frontmatter field

## Workflow

**Category:** `documentation` (standard)

**Rationale:** Creating new KB pages for historical reference. Standard workflow because:
- New pages being created
- Multiple related documents
- Needs outline for structure planning
- Historical context requires careful organization

**Phases:**
1. `/outline` - Define page structure for prescriptive workflow docs
2. Human approval of outline
3. `/write-docs` - Create the KB pages
4. `/review-docs` - Technical accuracy check
5. PR creation

### First Command

Run `/outline E06-T014a` (writer)

## Source Material

**Archived agents (10 files):**
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/pm.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/analyst.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/architect.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/designer.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/developer.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/qa.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/reviewer.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/writer.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/trainer.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/git-agent.md`

**Archived commands:**
- `.claude/archive/1_16/commands/*.md`
- `.claude/archive/1_16/commands/README.md`

**Example prescriptive specs:**
- `backlog/docs/specs/E05/` - Examples of detailed implementation code in specs

## Output Locations

- `apps/docs/src/ai-development/workflows/prescriptive.md` - Workflow overview
- `apps/docs/src/ai-development/agents/deprecated/*.md` - Individual agent pages
- `apps/docs/src/ai-development/commands/archived.md` - Archived commands (single page)

## Out of Scope

- Current deliberative agents/commands/workflow (E06-T014b)
- Modifying archived source files

## Technical Notes

The prescriptive workflow was characterized by:
- Analysts writing detailed implementation code in specs
- Less developer autonomy in implementation choices
- More rigid spec → implementation flow
- Used in E01-E05 tasks

## Document Outline

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Developers (human and AI) who encounter tasks with `agentic_style: "prescriptive"` and need to understand how those agents worked.

**Secondary:** Anyone studying workflow evolution for meta-agent training purposes.

**Skill level:** Intermediate - assumes familiarity with agentic workflows.

### Key Differences (Archived → Current)

Based on comparing `.claude/archive/1_16/` with `.claude/`:

| Aspect | Archived (Prescriptive) | Current (Deliberative) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Command structure** | Flat directory (`commands/*.md`) | Organized by agent (`commands/{agent}/*.md`) |
| **Workflows** | Single implicit flow | Formal workflow categories with variants |
| **Analyst role** | Wrote implementation specs with code | Proposes multiple approaches without code |
| **Architect role** | Validated existing specs | Selects approach AND writes implementation spec |
| **Developer autonomy** | Implemented specs exactly | Has autonomy within architectural constraints |
| **New commands** | — | `/investigate`, `/verify-fix`, `/outline`, `/write-docs`, `/review-docs`, `/analyze-schema`, `/review-migration` |

### Document Structure

#### 1. Prescriptive Workflow Overview (`workflows/prescriptive.md`)

**Structure:**

1. **What is Prescriptive Workflow?**
   - Definition and key characteristics
   - Warning callout: "This is archived/historical"

2. **How It Worked**
   - Single implicit workflow (no categories/variants)
   - Analyst wrote detailed specs with implementation code
   - Architect validated specs
   - Developer implemented exactly as specified

3. **Key Characteristics**
   - Detailed implementation code in specs
   - Less developer autonomy
   - Rigid spec → implementation flow

4. **Comparison with Deliberative**
   - Table showing key differences
   - Link to deliberative workflow page

5. **When You'll See This**
   - Tasks with `agentic_style: "prescriptive"`
   - How to interpret old specs

6. **Related Sections**
   - Link to deprecated agents
   - Link to archived commands

#### 2. Deprecated Agent Index (`agents/deprecated/index.md`)

Update the existing index page with:

1. **What Changed** callout
   - Summary of prescriptive → deliberative differences
   - Link to archived source files

2. **Agent Registry Table**
   | Agent | Archived Role | Key Difference |
   |-------|--------------|----------------|
   | Analyst | Wrote implementation specs with code | Now proposes approaches |
   | Architect | Validated specs | Now selects approach + writes spec |
   | Developer | Implemented specs exactly | Now has implementation autonomy |
   | (others) | Similar role | Minor changes or same |

3. **When You'll See These**
   - Tasks with `agentic_style: "prescriptive"`
   - Older specs containing implementation code
   - Reference for understanding past decisions

4. **Source Location**
   - Link to `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/`

#### 3. Individual Deprecated Agent Pages (10 pages)

**Concise template for each:**

```markdown
# {Agent Name} (Archived)

> **Archived:** This agent definition was archived on 2026-01-16.
> Current version: [link to current agent KB page]

## Role

[1-2 sentences from archived file]

## Key Differences from Current

[Table or bullets showing what changed]

## Source Reference

- Archived: `.claude/archive/1_16/agents/{agent}.md`
- Current: `.claude/agents/{agent}.md`
```

**Focus on agents with significant changes:**
- **Analyst** - Wrote specs → proposes approaches (major change)
- **Architect** - Validated → selects + writes spec (major change)
- **Developer** - Exactly as specified → has autonomy (moderate change)

**Brief pages for similar agents:**
- PM, Designer, QA, Reviewer, Writer, Trainer, Git Agent (minor or no changes)

- **Notes:**

#### Technical Accuracy

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Prescriptive Workflow Overview | ✅ | Accurate description of historical workflow |
| Deprecated Agent Index | ✅ | Correct agent registry with change levels |
| Individual Agent Pages (10) | ✅ | All match archived source content |
| Archived Commands | ✅ | Current structure accurately documented |
| VitePress Sidebar | ✅ | All 13 pages correctly linked |
| Cross-References | ✅ | Links to coming E06-T014b appropriately marked |

#### Verification Steps Completed

1. **Archived files verified** - All 10 agent files and 27+ command files exist in `.claude/archive/1_16/`
2. **Current command structure verified** - Documented structure matches actual `.claude/commands/` organization
3. **Build validation** - `pnpm docs:build` succeeds with no errors
4. **Sidebar configuration** - All pages linked in VitePress config.ts

#### Issues Found

**Must Fix:**
- None

**Should Fix:**
- None

**Suggestions:**
- The pre-existing `workflows/index.md` has outdated references to E06-T015 and E06-T016 (consolidated tasks). This should be updated in E06-T014b when the deliberative workflow page is created.
