# E06-T016: Document Deliberative Workflow Style in KB

> **CONSOLIDATED:** This task was absorbed into E06-T014b on 2026-01-16.

## Description

Document the current "deliberative" workflow style introduced in E06. This style gives developers autonomy - analysts propose approaches, architects set constraints, developers implement. Label as current/active.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Workflow page created at `apps/docs/src/ai-development/workflows/deliberative.md`
- [ ] AC2: Documents the deliberative workflow pattern
- [ ] AC3: References current agent/command definitions (documented in T014)
- [ ] AC4: Clearly labeled as current / used for new tasks
- [ ] AC5: Sidebar updated with new page
- [ ] AC6: `pnpm docs:build` succeeds with no errors

## Source Material

- Current agents: `.claude/agents/`
- Current commands: `.claude/commands/`
- Agent/command KB pages created in E06-T014b

## Output Location

- `apps/docs/src/ai-development/workflows/deliberative.md`

## Out of Scope

- Prescriptive workflow (T015)
- Modifying agent/command definitions
