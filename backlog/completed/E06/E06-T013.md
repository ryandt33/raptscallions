# E06-T013: Create AI Development KB Framework Structure

## Description

Create the KB folder structure and navigation for the "AI-Assisted Development" section (documenting how we use AI to develop, not AI development itself).

### Section Purpose

RaptScallions uses a heavily agentic development process where AI agents collaborate with humans throughout the development lifecycle - from requirements analysis through code review and QA. This KB section documents:

- **Concepts** - Core ideas (agent architecture, workflow states, task lifecycle)
- **Patterns** - Reusable approaches (TDD workflow, multi-agent handoff)
- **Decisions** - ADRs for agentic development choices
- **Agents** - What agents exist (current and deprecated) and their responsibilities
- **Commands** - What slash commands trigger agent workflows
- **Workflows** - How agents are orchestrated (prescriptive vs deliberative styles)
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

The section serves as a living document of how our AI-assisted development process works and how it has evolved over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Folder structure created at `apps/docs/src/ai-development/` with: concepts/, patterns/, decisions/, agents/current/, agents/deprecated/, commands/, workflows/, troubleshooting/
- [x] AC2: Index pages created for section and each subfolder (10 total) with placeholder content
- [x] AC3: Sidebar updated in `.vitepress/config.ts` with new section
- [x] AC4: `pnpm docs:build` succeeds with no errors

## Reference

- Existing KB structure: `apps/docs/src/`
- Sidebar config: `apps/docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- KB page design patterns: `apps/docs/src/contributing/kb-page-design.md`

## Out of Scope

- Agent/command/workflow content (T014, T015, T016)

## Future Improvements

These are potential enhancements that the writer agent should add to the KB improvements page (`apps/docs/src/ai-development/improvements.md`) after implementation:

1. **CI-based sync checking** - GitHub Action that compares `source_synced_at` timestamps in KB frontmatter against `.claude/` file modification dates; warns when source files are newer than KB copies

2. **Single-source includes** - Investigate VitePress markdown includes or symlinks to eliminate duplication entirely; `.claude/` files would BE the KB content with minimal wrapper pages

## History

| Date       | State    | Agent   | Notes                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2026-01-16 | DRAFT    | human   | Task created - framework structure only  |
| 2026-01-16 | ANALYZED | analyst | Analysis complete - recommends Approach A (Mirror Auth Domain Pattern) |
| 2026-01-16 | ANALYZED | analyst | Analysis updated per user clarifications: renamed section, expanded structure with concepts/patterns/decisions/troubleshooting, agents/current + agents/deprecated |
| 2026-01-16 | PLAN_REVIEW | designer | UX Review: NOT_APPLICABLE - backend-only task (task_type: backend), no UI components |
| 2026-01-16 | APPROVED | architect | Plan review: selected Approach A (Full Structure with Placeholder Indexes) |
| 2026-01-16 | IMPLEMENTED | developer | Created 10 index files, updated sidebar config, docs:build succeeds |
| 2026-01-16 | QA_PASSED | qa | All 4 ACs verified; build succeeds; report at E06-T013-qa-report.md |

## Reviews

### UX Review

- **Reviewer:** designer
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Verdict:** NOT_APPLICABLE
- **Notes:** This is a backend-only task (`task_type: backend`) that creates KB folder structure, markdown placeholder pages, and VitePress sidebar configuration. No user-facing UI components to review. Task proceeds directly to architecture/plan review.

### Plan Review

- **Reviewer:** architect
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Verdict:** APPROVED
- **Notes:** Selected Approach A (Full Structure with Placeholder Indexes). Creates complete folder structure with 10 index pages, following existing KB patterns from auth domain. Sidebar positioned after Contributing section. Spec at [E06-T013-spec.md](/backlog/docs/specs/E06/E06-T013-spec.md).

### QA Review

- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Verdict:** PASS
- **Notes:** All 4 acceptance criteria verified. Folder structure correct (9 subdirs), 10 index pages with proper frontmatter, sidebar configured correctly, docs:build succeeds. Full report: [E06-T013-qa-report.md](/backlog/docs/reviews/E06/E06-T013-qa-report.md)
