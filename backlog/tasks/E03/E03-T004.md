# E03-T004: Groups service and API routes

## Description

Implement GroupsService with business logic and REST API routes for CRUD operations, hierarchy navigation, and settings management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: GroupsService with create, getById, update, delete, list methods
- [ ] AC2: Methods for hierarchy: getChildren, getAncestors, getDescendants
- [ ] AC3: Settings inheritance logic (merge parent settings)
- [ ] AC4: POST /groups - create group (group_admin+)
- [ ] AC5: GET /groups/:id - get group with computed settings
- [ ] AC6: PATCH /groups/:id - update group (group_admin)
- [ ] AC7: DELETE /groups/:id - soft delete (group_admin)
- [ ] AC8: GET /groups/:id/children - list direct children
- [ ] AC9: GET /groups/:id/tree - full descendant tree
- [ ] AC10: Permission checks via CASL middleware

## Technical Notes

Use ltree for hierarchy queries. Service layer handles settings inheritance by walking up the tree.
