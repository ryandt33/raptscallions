# E06-T014: Document Agents and Commands in KB (Umbrella)

## Description

**This task has been split into two subtasks:**

| Subtask | Title | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **E06-T014a** | Document prescriptive workflow agents | Historical/archived agents from E01-E05 |
| **E06-T014b** | Document deliberative workflow agents | Current/active agents for E06+ |

## Split Rationale

The original task was attempting to document all agents and commands without distinguishing between:

1. **Prescriptive workflow** (E01-E05) - Historical approach with detailed implementation specs
2. **Deliberative workflow** (E06+) - Current approach with developer autonomy

These should be documented separately because:
- Different source locations (`.claude/archive/` vs `.claude/agents/`)
- Different framing (historical vs current)
- Different cross-references (deprecated vs active)
- Logical progression: understand history before current state

## Task Dependency Graph

```
E06-T013 (AI Development KB structure)
    │
    ├── E06-T014a (prescriptive agents - historical)
    │       │
    │       └── E06-T014b (deliberative agents - current)
    │               │
    │               ├── E06-T015 (prescriptive workflow docs)
    │               │
    │               └── E06-T016 (deliberative workflow docs)
```

## Original Acceptance Criteria (Redistributed)

Original ACs have been split between subtasks:

| Original AC | Now In |
|-------------|--------|
| AC1: Agent pages in `agents/current/` | E06-T014b |
| AC2: Command pages in `commands/` | E06-T014b |
| AC3: Agent index updated | E06-T014a (deprecated), E06-T014b (current) |
| AC4: Command index updated | E06-T014b |
| AC5: Sidebar updated | E06-T014a, E06-T014b |
| AC6: `pnpm docs:build` succeeds | E06-T014a, E06-T014b |

**Additional ACs added:**
- E06-T014a: Archived agents documented in `agents/deprecated/`
- E06-T014a: Prescriptive workflow overview page
- E06-T014b: Index states "source of truth" for current workflow

## History

| Date       | State     | Agent  | Notes                                                |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-01-16 | DRAFT     | human  | Task created - inventory of current agents/commands  |
| 2026-01-16 | REPLANNED | pm     | Restructured to match E06 task format |
| 2026-01-16 | OUTLINED  | writer | Document outline created |
| 2026-01-16 | SPLIT     | pm     | Split into E06-T014a (prescriptive) and E06-T014b (deliberative) per user request |

## Reviews

### Plan Review

- **Reviewer:** pm
- **Date:** 2026-01-16
- **Verdict:** SPLIT
- **Notes:** Task split into E06-T014a and E06-T014b to properly separate historical prescriptive workflow from current deliberative workflow documentation
