# E06-T014: Document Existing Agents and Commands in KB

## Description

Create reference documentation for all current agents and commands. Each agent/command gets a KB page with summary and link to source definition.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: KB page created for each agent in `.claude/agents/`
- [ ] AC2: KB page created for each command in `.claude/commands/`
- [ ] AC3: Agent index updated with links to agent pages
- [ ] AC4: Command index updated with links to command pages
- [ ] AC5: Sidebar updated with new pages
- [ ] AC6: `pnpm docs:build` succeeds with no errors

## Source Material

- Agent definitions: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Command definitions: `.claude/commands/*.md`

## Output Location

- Agent pages: `apps/docs/src/ai-development/agents/`
- Command pages: `apps/docs/src/ai-development/commands/`

## Out of Scope

- Workflow documentation (T015, T016)
- Archived/historical agents (T015)
