# E06-T002b: Create KB Page Design Pattern Guide

## Description

Document the design patterns for KB pages including layout structure, headings hierarchy, code block conventions, callout usage, cross-referencing patterns, and VitePress markdown features. This establishes consistency for all KB documentation.

## Why This Matters

KB authors need clear patterns to follow when writing documentation. Without guidelines, pages will have inconsistent structure (some use H2 for sections, others H3), varying code block styles, and unclear navigation. This guide ensures all KB pages feel cohesive and professional.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Page structure pattern is documented (frontmatter → overview → sections → related links)
- [ ] AC2: Heading hierarchy is documented (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- [ ] AC3: Code block conventions are documented (language tags, inline vs block, copy button usage)
- [ ] AC4: Callout patterns are documented (tip, warning, danger, info - when to use each)
- [ ] AC5: Cross-referencing patterns are documented (internal links, external links, anchor links)
- [ ] AC6: Table usage is documented (when to use tables vs lists)
- [ ] AC7: Image/diagram guidelines are provided (if applicable to KB)
- [ ] AC8: VitePress-specific features are documented (search keywords, custom containers, badges)
- [ ] AC9: Example page template is provided showing all patterns in practice
- [ ] AC10: Document is created at `apps/docs/src/contributing/kb-page-design.md`

## Constraints

- Must align with VitePress markdown capabilities (no unsupported features)
- Must reference doc-001 design alignment review for context
- Must be practical and actionable (show examples, not just theory)
- Should be concise (under 1000 words, heavy on examples)

## Out of Scope

- Content strategy or what to document (focus on HOW to write, not WHAT to write)
- VitePress configuration details (covered in contributing docs as needed)
- Application UI design (this is KB design only)

## Context

- VitePress uses GitHub-flavored markdown with extensions
- Design alignment review (doc-001) identified need for structured KB content
- This guide enables consistent authoring across all domains (auth, database, api, ui, etc.)
- Should reference modern_agricultural design principles for visual consistency

## Documentation Updates

**Writer:** writer
**Date:** 2026-01-13

### Files Updated

| File | Changes | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` | Added "Page Design Patterns" subsection under Documentation Standards with reference to KB Page Design guide | Developers need to know where to find KB authoring guidelines when writing documentation. Links directly to the comprehensive guide. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Added "Authoring KB Pages" subsection under Knowledge Base section with detailed reference | Claude Code needs to be aware of KB page design patterns when creating or updating documentation. Provides clear pointer to the guide with summary of what it covers. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Added "Authoring KB Pages" note under Knowledge Base Structure section | Architecture doc readers need to know how to contribute KB content. Brief reference maintains flow while pointing to detailed guide. |

### Summary

Updated three canonical documentation files to reference the new KB Page Design Patterns guide. Each update adds a clear signpost directing developers and AI agents to the comprehensive authoring guidelines when creating KB documentation. This ensures the design guide is discoverable at decision points where developers would need it.

### Verification

- [x] All code references are accurate (links point to correct file paths)
- [x] Examples are runnable (no code examples added, only references)
- [x] Links work (internal markdown links verified)
- [x] Formatting is consistent (follows existing doc style in each file)
