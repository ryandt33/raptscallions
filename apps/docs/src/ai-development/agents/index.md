# Agent Documentation

RaptScallions uses specialized AI agents throughout the development lifecycle. Each agent has defined responsibilities and is invoked via slash commands.

## Agent Categories

- [Current Agents](/ai-development/agents/current/) — Active agents in use today
- [Deprecated Agents](/ai-development/agents/deprecated/) — Historical agents no longer in use

::: info Coming Soon
Detailed agent documentation will be added in [E06-T014](/backlog/tasks/E06/E06-T014.md) (current) and [E06-T015](/backlog/tasks/E06/E06-T015.md) (deprecated).
