## Workflow Styles

| Style | Era | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Prescriptive | Historical | Fixed sequences, less agent autonomy |
| Deliberative | Current | Flexible reasoning, agent-driven decisions |

## Expected Topics

- Prescriptive workflow (historical)
- Deliberative workflow (current)
- Migration from prescriptive to deliberative
