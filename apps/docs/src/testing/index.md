# Testing Patterns & Conventions

The testing domain covers Vitest configuration, test structure using the AAA pattern (Arrange/Act/Assert), mocking strategies, and Fastify-specific testing patterns including plugin encapsulation workarounds.

## What's Here

**Patterns** — AAA test structure, test factories, dependency injection for testing, mocking strategies, Fastify integration tests

**Troubleshooting** — Plugin encapsulation issues, `vi.mock()` failures, type errors in tests, async test timeouts

## Coming Soon

This section is currently being populated with documentation from the testing infrastructure (E01-T007, E02-T008) and real test examples from implemented features.

Check back soon or see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryandt33/raptscallions) for implementation progress.
